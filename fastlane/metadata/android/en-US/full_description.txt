Just Delete Me (JustDeleteMe.xyz) maps out the account deletion procedures for many platforms and provides a directory with instructions on how to request the deletion of your data from them.

You can use it to quickly delete your accounts without having to search through FAQs, privacy policies, or other documents, especially for services that intentionally make this information hard to find.

This app is designed to be an optimized mobile version of the website for quick and easy access.
